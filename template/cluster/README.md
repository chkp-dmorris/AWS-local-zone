## Important: Lambda Template Location
If you are deploying into AWS Local Zones, you must upload the `network-border-group-lambda.yaml` file to your own S3 bucket and update the `TemplateURL` property in the cluster template to point to your S3 location. This is required for the nested stack to work correctly.

Example S3 upload command:
```
aws s3 cp ../common/network-border-group-lambda.yaml s3://<your-bucket-name>/network-border-group-lambda.yaml
```

Update the following in your cluster template:
```
TemplateURL: https://<your-bucket-name>.s3.amazonaws.com/network-border-group-lambda.yaml
```

If you do not update the Lambda location, the deployment will fail in Local Zones.

## How to Use These Templates
1. **Upload Lambda Template (Local Zones only):**
   - Upload `network-border-group-lambda.yaml` from the `common` folder to your S3 bucket.
   - Update the `TemplateURL` in your cluster template to point to your S3 location.
2. **Choose Your Deployment:**
   - Use `cluster-master.yaml` to create a new VPC and deploy a cluster.
   - Use `cluster.yaml` to deploy a cluster into an existing VPC.
3. **Launch via AWS Console:**
   - Click the launch links below or use the AWS Console to create a CloudFormation stack.
4. **Parameter Guidance:**
   - Fill in required parameters, including VPC, subnets, and set `IsLocalZoneDeployment` to `true` if deploying in Local Zones.
5. **Review Outputs and Troubleshooting:**
   - After deployment, review stack outputs for connection details.
   - If deployment fails in Local Zones, verify the Lambda template location and TemplateURL.
